<p><a class="folder" href="#folded_help:backend:start_1">Detailed help </a></p><div class="folded hidden" id="folded_help:backend:start_1"><pre class="code">Usage:
  mpsat mode [options] inputfilename [outputfilename]

Modes:
  Reachability-like properties checking modes:
    -D    Deadlock checking.
    -F    Find a reachable marking satisfying a given REACH predicate.
    -Fs   Find a reachable STG state satisfying a given REACH predicate.
    -Fa   Check an SVA-like assertion (a global invariant).
    The -Fs mode differs from -F in the following ways:
    * only configurations without maximal dummy events are explored;
    * REACH operators referring to STG signals become available;
    * the semantics of REACH operator &#039;@&#039; checking the enabledness status
      of an event/transition/signal changes: in addition to the usual Petri
      net enabledness, an entity can be enabled via a sequence of dummies.
    The -Fa mode differs from -Fs in the following ways:
    * the syntax is SVA-like, i.e. a Boolean formula that can refer only to
      values of STG signals;
    * a global invariant rather than a reachability predicate is checked,
      i.e. to check the same property using -Fs one has to invert it.
  Encoding conflicts detection and resolution modes:
    -C    CSC conflict detection.
    -N    Normalcy property checking mode.
    -R    Resolve encoding conflicts.
    -U    USC conflict detection.
  Synthesis modes:
    -E    Derive complex-gate implementation.
    -G    Derive gC-elements implementation.
    -S    Derive standard-C implementation.
    -T    Logic decomposition and technology mapping (experimental).
At most one the listed modes may be specified.

For the modes -C, -E, -Fs, -Fa, -G, -N, -R, -S, -T, -U the
file inputfilename must be an STG unfolding. If the
legacy *.mci format is used then transition names must
carry information about the corresponding signal; the
format is [prefix.]identifier[+|-][/number], where prefix is
either of O,I,i (for outputs, internal signals, and inputs,
respectively; dummies have no prefix),
e.g. O.x-/1, I.csc+/1, i.a-, dum/1, t1. This format is
produced by the PUNF tool. Alternatively, PUNF can produce new
PNML-based format *.pnml or *.pnml.gz, which stores this
in a more elegant way information, and also fixes other issues.
The original STG must be consistent. Moreover, it should
satisfy the CSC property for any of the synthesis modes (-E, -G, -S, -T).

The normalcy property should hold to avoid inverters on gates&#039; inputs.
Normalcy violation can be caused by the following factors:
  - An event have triggers with different signs. If this is
    the case, mpsat prints a trace leading to that event.
  - An instance of a signal transition has triggers with the
    same sign (which means that the signal cannot be n-normal),
    while another instance of this signal has triggers with
    the opposite sign (i.e. the signal cannot be p-normal).
    If this is the case, mpsat prints two traces
    leading to these instances.
  - There is a CSC conflict. If this is the case, mpsat prints
    results similar to the -C mode.
  - Nothing above. Then mpsat makes hypothesis about the
    normalcy type of each signal, based on the signs of the triggers.
    Then it tries to disprove the made hypothesis, and if it is
    possible, mpsat prints three traces: one to show the
    event for which a hypothesis was made, and the other two to
    show the violation of normalcy by definition.

Options:
  -! - Disable branching on auxiliary variables.
  Some of the variables in the formula might be functions of
  other variables, so it is possible not to branch on them
  without affecting the correctness. This, however, has mixed
  effect on performance. You can try this option if you feel lucky.
  This option is available in all modes.

  -$N - Switch to SAT solver N (0-1).
  Currently two solvers, zChaff (N=0) and MiniSat (N=1) are
  supported. The default is chosen heuristically, depending on the mode.
  This option is available in all modes.

  -@ - Output configurations rather than traces.
  The numbering of events starts from 1.
  This option is available in the following modes:
  -C, -D, -F, -Fs, -Fa, -N, -U; it is silently ignored in any other mode.

  -a[N] - Compute all solutions (might be slow).
  The search does not stop after the first encountered solution,
  but continues until all solutions are computed. Since the
  number of solutions can be exponential in the size of the input,
  the search may take a lot of time and memory. Optionally, the
  number of computed solutions can be restricted to N&gt;0. Note that N
  is just an approximate value, the actual number of computed
  solutions can slightly differ from N.
  This option is available in the following modes:
  -C, -D, -F, -Fs, -Fa, -N, -R, -T, -U. It is an error to specify this
  option in any other mode. This option must not be specified
  together with the -f option.

  -b - Generate backward conflict constraints.
  Additional constraints are genereted, conveying that no two
  mp-events in the preset of any mp-conditon can belong to the
  same mp-configuration. These constraints are redundant, but
  can in certain cases improve the performance.
  This option is silently ignored if the input file is not a merged process.

  -c[s|l|COEFF=EXPR] - Specifies the coefficients for the cost function.
  This option is valid only in the encoding conflict resolution (-R) and
  logic decomposition and technology mapping (-T) modes and it is silently
  ignored unless also the -f option is specified.
  This option specifies the coefficiens for the function computing the
  cost of the transformation (signal insertion or concurrency reduction)
  on each step of the encoding conflict resolution or logic decomposition.
  This function is a weighted sum of the following components (with the
  corresponding COEFF):
    csc:  the number of unresolved CSC cores
    usc:  the number of unresolved USC cores
    del:  the number of delayed transitions
    trig: the number of triggers of output and internal transitions
    seq:  the number of sequential insertions (or |U| if a concurrency
          reduction U-n-&gt;t was applied)
    conc: the number of concurrent insertions
    lock: the number computed by adding up the following numbers for each
          pair (a,b) of non-locked signals in the modified STG:
                  1 if both a and b are inputs;
                  2 if one of a, b is an input;
                  4 if both a and b are output or internal signals;
          if the option -r is not used (i.e. concurrency reductions are not
          allowed) then the difference between the values for the modified
          and the original STGs is used instead, which coincides with 2*I+4*O,
          where I is the numbers of inputs and O is the numbers of output or
          intermal signals which are not locked with the newly inserted signal.
  The defining expressions EXPR for coefficients can use integer constants,
  the operations +, -, *, /, %%, and the following macros referring to the STG:
    #i - the number of input signals
    #o - the number of output signals
    #I - the number of internal signals
    #d - the number of dummies
    #s - the total number of signals (excluding dummies)
    #p - the number of places
    #t - the number of transitions
  They must evaluate to non-negative integers; the default expressions are:
      csc=#s*8, usc=#s*4, del=#s*2, trig=#s*1, seq=#s*4, conc=#s*8, lock=50.
  If -cs or -cl is specified then pre-defined mode-dependent expressions are
  used, which heuristically minimise the number of signals/literals.
  If several -c options are specified, they are processed from left to right.

  -d string - Specifies additional mode-dependent data.
  This option is available in the following modes:
    -F[s] (extended reachability analysis) - the string must either
       contain a REACH proterty the target state should satisfy or be of
       the form @filename to name the file containing a REACH proterty.
    -T (logic decomposition and technology mapping) - the string must
       name the file containing a gate library in the GENLIB format.
  It is an error to specify this option in any other mode.

  -f - Looking for a solution minimising the cost function (might be slow).
  Usually this means that the sum of the lengths of the traces
  is minimised, though the criterion is different in the
  normalcy (-N) and encoding conflict resolution (-R) modes.
  This option is available in the following modes:
  -C, -D, -F, -Fs, -Fa, -N, -R, -T, -U. It is an error to specify this
  option in any other mode. This option must not be specified
  together with the -a option.

  -g[[!][N]] - Specifies gates/latches used for logic decomposition.
  This option restricts the class of gates/latches which can be used in
  the main loop of the decomposition algorithm as follows: `!&#039; disables
  using latches, and N&gt;1 is the maximal allowed number of gate/latch
  inputs (not counting the feedback for latches). The other
  gates/latches in the library still may be used during the technology
  mapping phase. For example, -g! disables the use of latches but allows
  all the combinational gates from the library, -g2 allows to use only
  combinational gates and latches with up to two inputs (plus the feedback
  input for latches), and -g!2 combines the effect of -g! and -g2, i.e.
  it allows to use only combinational gates with up to two inputs.
  This option is available only in the logic decomposition (-T) mode.

  -l[+|-] - Specifies whether to generate inclusion constraints.
  Inclusion constraints usually speed up the computation,
  but might lead to incorrect results for non-conflict-free
  prefixes. If this option is not specified, inclusion
  constraints are generated iff the prefix is conflict-free.
  This option is available in the following modes:
  -C, -E, -Fs, -Fa, -G, -N, -R, -S, -T, -U. It is an error to specify
  this option in any other mode.

  -mN - Using method N (1-9).
  For some of the modes several solving methods are implemented,
  and this option allows one to specify which one is to be used.
  This option is available in the following modes:
    -D (deadlock detection):
       -m1 - use cut-offs
       -m2 (default) - ignore cut-offs
    -C, -N, -U (CSC/normalcy/USC checking):
       -m1 (default) - process all signals/places together
       -m2 - process each signal/place in turn
  It is an error to specify this option in any other mode, or
  to specify the method which is not defined for the current mode.

  -pN - Controls the use of parallel (concurrent) inserions.
  The possible values of N:
    0 - concurrent insertions are not allowed
    1 - only valid concurrent insertions of the form
        u-||n-&gt;t, where u is in ****t, are allowed
    2 - all valid concurrent insertions are allowed
  This option is valid only in the encoding conflict resolution (-R)
  and logic decomposition and technology mapping (-T) modes.
  It is an error to specify this option in any other mode.
  The default is -p0.

  -r - Allows to use concurrency reduction for encoding conflict resolution.
  This option is valid only in the encoding conflict resolution (-R) mode.
  One should be careful when using this option: the resulting STG is guaranteed
  to be correct only if all the transitions of the STG are weakly fair. Note
  that this assumption is not compositional: if concurrency reductions are
  performed both in the STG and in its environment, a deadlock can be
  introduced, even if the STG and the environment were initially weakly fair.

  -s - Store the CNF formula for an external SAT solver.
  This option is available in all modes.

  -t - Perform logic decomposition down to the gate/latch level.
  New signals are inserted until each local signal can be mapped to a single
  gate/latch in the library (perhaps, with input and/or output inversions).
  (If the option is not given, some of the local signals can be implemented
  by several gates.) This option requires more time, but produces solutions
  consistent with Petrify, so Petrify&#039;s technology mapping can be used.
  This option is valid only in the logic decomposition (-T) mode.

  -vN - The verbosity level (0&lt;=N&lt;=9, the default is 0).
  This option is available in all modes.

  -w[N] - Wait for user input before exiting (prevents the window from closing).
  The possible values of N:
    0 - do not wait for user input, exit immediately
    1 - wait for user input only if there are errors
    2 - wait for user input only if there are errors or warnings
    3 - always wait for user input
  The default is -w0, and -w is equivalent to -w3.
  This option is available in all modes.

  -x - Saves the results in mpsat.xml.
  This option is available in all modes.</pre>

<pre class="code">Usage:
     punf [-h]
or
     punf [options] [-f=]filename

Options (may be given in any order):

-h     Help.

-#     Using non-local configuration as cut-off correspondents.
         The current implementation is VERY INEFFICIENT.
         This option is not currently supported in the LTL mode.
-$n    Switch to SAT solver n (0-1).
         If n=0 then zChaff is used.
         If n=1 then MiniSAT is used (default).
-@[n]  Using ordering n (0-4).
         Specifies the ordering on configurations of the unfolding.
         If n is not specified or -@ is not used then the default
         value n=3 (for prefixes) or n=4 (for merged processes) is used.
         If n=0 then the set inclusion is used.
         If n=1 then the McMillan&#039;s order is used.
         If n=2 then the size-lexicographical order is used.
         If n=3 then the total Esparza/Roemer/Vogler (ERV) order is used.
         If n=4 then the total order with an efficient SAT encoding is used.
       Only the ERV order is currently supported in the LTL mode.
-!     Do not optimize preset trees (cheap optimization is performed anyway).
       (Ignored if -M is specified.)
-c     Do not store cut-off events (except the successful terminals in
       the LTL mode).
-d     When unfolding an STG, allow dummy cut-off events.
       If this option is not specified, a dummy event e can only be
       declared cut-off if its corresponding configuration C is a
       subset of [e], and [e]\C contains only dummies.
       This option has effect only when unfolding an STG.
       It is automatically specified if the STG contains only dummy signals.
       (Currently ignored if -M is specified.)
[-f=]filename
       Specifies the input file. It must be in either FORMAT_N or
       FORMAT_N2 format (produced by the PEP tool). Alternatively,
       it must have the suffix `.g&#039; and be in the STG format;
       then an STG unfolding prefix (which may differ
       from the underlying Petri net&#039;s unfolding prefix) is produced.
       Aa an experimental feature, high-level nets are supported.
       For now, only strictly safe nets are allowed, and there are
       some further restrictions, described in the manual.
-L     LTL mode.
       The input net must be a product of Buechi automaton and a system.
-m[=filename]
       Specifies the name of the resulting file, whose extension also
       specifies the format. It can be either the legacy *.mci format
       for prefixes, the legacy *.mp format for merged processes (if -M
       is specified), or the new PNML-based *.pnml or *.pnml.gz format.
       If this option is not specified then the filename for the result
       is obtained by removing from the input filename the suffix `.ll_net&#039;,
       `.g&#039; or `.hl_net&#039; (if present), and appending the suffix `.pnml.gz&#039;,
       and the resulting prefix or merged process is stored in the new
       PNML-based format. If the filename is not specified (i.e. just -m
       is given) then no output file is created.
-N=n   Specifies the number of working threads (by default, it is equal
       to the number of processors). (Currently ignored if -M is specified.)</pre>

<div class="plugin_include_content plugin_include__help:backend:pcomp" id="plugin_include__help__backend__pcomp">

<h2 id="pcomp_command_line_options">PComp command line options</h2>
<pre class="code">Usage:
    pcomp [options] [@]file...

 The files in the command line are interpreted as STG files, except
 when prefixed with `@&#039;, in which case the file should contain a
 list of STG files, one per line (useful for avoiding the shell
 restriction on the length of the command line when composing many
 STGs). All the STGs, both in the command line and in the `@&#039;-prefixed
 files, are used for composition.

 * The output signals of the STGs must be disjoint (this constraint
   can be waived with the -o option), and their union comprises
   the output signals of the composition. On the other hand, the input
   signals can be shared by several STGs, and also an output signal of
   some STG can be an input signal of zero or more other STGs.
 * The internal and dummy signals, as well as places, are renamed
   whenever necessary to avoid name clashes.
 * The composed STG is simplified by removing duplicate places.
 * 2-phase, 4-phase and mixed-phase STGs can be liberally composed.

Options:
  -d  Convert the common interface signals into dummy signals
      (useful for composing handshake components).
  -f[file]
      Stores the composed STG in file rather than standard output.
      The extension (.g, .pnml, or .pnml.gz) determines the format.
      If file is not specified, pcomp.g is used.
  -h  Print this help message and exit.
  -i  Convert the common interface signals into internal signals
      (useful for composing handshake components).
  -l[file]
      If the file name is not provided then `pcomp.xml.gz&#039; is used.
      If the file name ends with `.xml&#039; or `xml.gz&#039; then the
      correspondence between the places and transitions of the
      component STGs and those of the composed STG is stored.
      Otherwise place names of the composed STG are stored, so that
      the i-th line corresponds to the places of i-th component STG
      Note that the same place can occur in several lines - this
      happens when some duplicate place is removed, and some
      equivalent place is listed instead.
  -o  Allow the STGs to share outputs.
  -p  Before doing the parallel composition, remove places whose
      presets do not contain dummy transitions and whose postsets
      contain only shared input signals on which the labelling is
      injective. This transformation results in a composed STG with
      fewer places, which has bisimilar behaviour provided the
      composition is free from computational interference. This
      option is incompatible with -o.
  -r  Rename all dummy transitions, so that their names do not
      contain &#039;+&#039;, &#039;-&#039;, or &#039;/&#039;. (Needed for compatibility with tools
      that do not allow dummy transitions to have signs, e.g. Petrify.)
  -u  Keep unused signal transition phases. This option considers
      e.g. x+ and x- as independent transition labels. By default,
      if two STGs are composed, and one of them has x+ but no x-,
      while the other has x- but no x+, the composed STG will have
      no transitions labelled by either x+ or x-. However, if this
      option is specified, both labels will occur in the composed STG.</pre>
